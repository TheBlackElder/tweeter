# Tweeter Project  

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses  HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX.

## Features

+ This responsive web application allows users to send their own messages out into the world (as long as they keep it under 140 characters).
+ The right side of the navigation bar is a toggle button that slides down the tweet box making it visible, and then focuses in on the text area.
+ If the tweet box is visible, one click on the navigation toggle button slides the tweet box up making it hidden.
+ While scrolling through a page of posts, a second animated toggle button appears on the bottom right side allowing users to be brought back up to the tweet box at the top of the page. 
+ The use of CSS box-shadows, animations and hovers assist in identifying the clickable features on the page.
